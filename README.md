# Wind Os

I opened this repo to implement a couple of beautiful UI concepts in Xaml to show that Windows Application can look better with little effort. 

I spent one or two hours (average) after I get home from work to write each Xaml Page. So I expect Microsoft Developers to spend more times and effort to improve Windows UWP Application.
