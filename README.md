# Wind Os
![./Inspiration/Icon/WindOs/storm.png](./storm.png)

I opened this repo to implement a couple of beautiful UI concepts in Xaml to show that Windows Application can look better with little effort. 

I spent one or two hours (average) after I get home from work to write each Xaml Page. So I expect Microsoft Developers to spend more times and effort to improve Windows UWP Application.

I tried to do not share Xaml code between pages so that you can see all the xamls in a single file. My codes are not clean and I don't have much time making them better. If you think you can help, I accept pull request.
